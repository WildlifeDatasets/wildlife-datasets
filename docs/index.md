This website contains the documentation for the [WildlifeDatasets](https://github.com/WildlifeDatasets/wildlife-datasets) project. 

The aim of the project is to provide comprehensive overview of datasets for wildlife individual re-identification and an easy-to-use package for developers of machine learning methods. The core functionality includes:

- overview of 52 publicly available wildlife re-identification datasets and 3 metadatasets.
- utilities to mass download and convert them into a unified format and fix some wrong labels.
- used for training our models [MegaDescriptor](./megadescriptor.md) and [WildFusion](./wildfusion.md).
- synergy with [WildlifeTools](https://github.com/WildlifeDatasets/wildlife-tools) used for training ML models.
