This website contains the documentation for the [Wildlife datasets](https://github.com/WildlifeDatasets/wildlife-datasets) project. 

The aim of the project is to provide comprehensive overview of datasets for wildlife individual re-identification and an easy-to-use package for developers of machine learning methods. The core functionality includes:

- overview of 42 publicly available wildlife re-identification datasets.
- utilities to mass download and convert them into a unified format and fix some wrong labels.
- default splits for several machine learning tasks including the ability create additional splits.
